?	System dependencies: I use the Zend Studio on the Windows computer, the database is  MySql
?	Configuration: change the database setting in the ¡°application/configs/application.ini¡± to your local database, in here, I use the mysql
?	Database creation: use the ¡°sql/shopping.sql¡± to create the tables and the data
?	Deployment instructions 1:
When you go to the http://localhost/shopping/public/, you could see the vote page:
 

Input the username Tom and the password Tom to login


If you click the vote, the vote_count would increase by one.  
Choose the item you like and then click the check cart.
 
The system would save your cart in the database, so each time you login you can check your cart.


?	Deployment instructions 2:
This project is only for a practice, I use the Zend MVC Framework to do the programming. This is a project to practice MVC programming, so there is little html+css+javascript in this project.
